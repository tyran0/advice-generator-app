## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML Tags
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) CSS Preprocessor
- [Advice Slip JSON API](https://api.adviceslip.com/)

### What I learned

First thing that I learned, is how to make requests and retreive data
with Fetch API. Together with Advice Slip JSON API, I successfully
completed one of the goals for this project.

Lastly I used Windows Narrator for accessability testing. It helped me to
figure out how my page appears for visually impaired people, and I was
able to add missing labels.
